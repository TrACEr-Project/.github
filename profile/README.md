TrACEr is a project under the Department of Data Science and Knowledge Discovery at SimulaMet. The project started in 2020 with partners from COPSAC (Danish Pediatric Asthma Center), University of Copenhagen and University of Amsterdam, and it has been funded by the Research Council of Norway and Novo Nordisk Foundation. 

Data mining holds the promise to improve our understanding of dynamics of complex systems such
as the human brain or metabolome by discovering the underlying patterns in data collected from these systems. However, discovering those patterns and understanding how those patterns change in time is a challenging task. The complexity of the systems requires collection of both dynamic and static data sets from multiple sources using different technologies recording the behavior of the system from complementary viewpoints, and there is a lack of data mining methods that can find the hidden patterns in such complex data.

The primary objective of the TrACEr project has been to develop novel data mining techniques to jointly analyze static and dynamic data sets to discover underlying patterns and how those patterns change in time. We introduce a constrained data fusion framework that can jointly analyze heterogeneous data sets in the form of matrices and higher-order tensors incorporating various loss functions, different types of coupling and constraints, and revealing evolving patterns.

The secondary objective of the project has been to use the developed methods to understand the human metabolome through the analysis of longitudinal metabolomics measurements together with relevant data from other sources such as genetics, microbiome data in order to discover the underlying patterns, i.e., groups of metabolites acting together, and how those patterns change in time.
